# SwiftUI-Form-Example

This is an example project utilizing the new Form object in SwiftUI (Beta2) release on the 17th June.

The `Form` is a generic structure that is used as a container for grouping controls used for data entry, such as in settings or inspectors.

In this example we explore some properties of the Form which include.
- Sections
- Responding to state changes
- Data input
- Data pickers
- Auto styling of form elements

As a bonus, I've implemented a `Bindable` data object to fully utilise SwiftUI capabilities.
I've also included a function to send the order to a fictious server that responds with the exact same payload.
